Skills - hMod plug-in adding combat and build related skills.

Overview:
Each player hew a few skills, and exp\level of each of them. Level can be from 1 to 15.

Each block in the world hew a durability from 1 to 15 equal to it builder's skill. Or base value from properties if it wasn't build by hands.

When player trying to destroy block his 'damage' calculating as "destroy_skill_for_target_block" + "tool_bonus". If 'damage' more then block durability, it will be broken, otherwise durability will decreased by one.
Gained exp equal dealed damage.

When player place block, block's durability set equal to appropriate create skill. Placing any block will give you only +1 exp.

If combat system turned on:

When player get attacked by any entity he hew a chance to dodge. Successful dodge will give you +1 exp.

When someone hit other one(and dodge failed):
Damage to defender = (weapon_damage * (1 + (weapon_skill * weapon_mod_from_properties)))
Damage to defender armor = damage_to_defender - defender_armor_skill
Damage to defender hp = damage_to_defender - (defense_of_all_armor_parts * armor_mod_from_properties)
Defender gain +1 exp for each wearied part of armor, attacker gain weapon exp equal to defender loosed hp.
